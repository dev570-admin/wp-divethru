               <h1>Feeling Valued: A Guide <br>To Your Emotions</h1>

               <h6>PUBLISHED MAY 18TH 2021 & UPDATED ON DEC 7TH, 2021</h6>

               <p>Thank you”</p>

               <p>“Well done!”</p>

               <p>“We’re so happy to have you as part of our family.”<br>
               “I love you.”</p>

               <p>“Thank you for helping me.”

               <p>You’ve probably heard these phrases before, right? Don’t they make you feel so loved, cherished, 
               appreciated, and valued? There’s nothing more welcoming and warming than feeling like people love
               and appreciate you for what you’ve done and who you are. You feel seen and wanted! We both know
               that there’s noooo better feeling than that. That’s right, folks! Today, we’re talking all about that
               metaphorical (or literal) feeling of a good ‘ol pat on the back and diving into everything related to
               feeling VALUED!</p>

               <h4>A Deeper Look At Feeling Valued</h4>
               <p>The Oxford Dictionary <b>defines</b> ‘valued’ as “considered to be important or beneficial; cherished.” And you know what? We super agree with that! When we feel valued, we feel like we’re important and that we’ve done a good job! Who doesn’t want to feel like that?</p>

               <p>Feeling valued is often associated with how employees feel in the workplace, and of course, every employee wants to feel this way! You want to feel like your work is making a difference and that your performance and hard work is being recognized. But feeling valued can also show up in other areas of our lives.</p>

               <p>Romantic <b>relationships</b> are a place where we LONG to feel valued. We want our partners to see  the little and big things that we do for them every day. Love is something that we choose to practice, and having that choice (and effort) be recognized can make you feel soooooo fucking good!</p>

               <p>But feeling valued isn’t limited to romance and the office. It’s something that transcends all aspects of your life. When you put your effort into something, you want that effort to berecognized. This recognition could come from parents, siblings, friends, people online, you nameit! But when you do get that recognition you feel so loved, and SO valued!</p>

               <h4>How Feeling Valued Shows Up Mentally</h4>
               <p>Feeling valued has its side effects. Don’t worry! They’re all good. No allergic reactions here — only happiness! We promise. Here are some ways that feeling valued can impact your mentalwellbeing:</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Overall happiness</li>
                  <li>Boost in <a href="https://divethru.com/self-confidence-and-self-esteem/">confidence</a></li>
                  <li>Better sleep</li>
                  <li>Increased productivity</li>
                  <li>Sparks of creativity</li>
                  <li>Good thoughts</li>
               </ul>

               <p>With all of these amazing benefits, we think that everyone should feel valued more often! We should have a parade in everyone’s honour! Wouldn’t that be awesome? Constant parades 24/7. What a life! Anyway…let’s snap out of this amazing daydream (insert Cher’s iconic “SNAP OUT OF IT!”) and get back to the article!</p>

               <h4>How Feeling Valued Shows Up Physically</h4>

               <p>Yes, of course, there is a warm and fuzzy feeling when we feel valued, but did you know that there are other physical sensations that come along with this emotion? Yep! And the best part is that they’re all really positive. No bad vibes, only good ones! </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Reduced <a href="https://divethru.com/stress-management/">stress and anxiety</a></li>
                  <li>Increased attentiveness and focus</li>
                  <li>Increased <a href="https://divethru.com/how-to-get-through-day-with-no-motivation/">motivation</a></li>
                  <li>Improved productivity</li>

               <p>Feeling valued feels so good! And when you feel good, you feel like you can do anything! You also feel like you WANT to do anything! Your energy SKYROCKETS and you just feel happy!!!!! And when you feel happy, we feel happy! </p>

               <h4>5 Ways To Embrace Feeling Valued</h4>
               <p>Okay, so we’ve established that you’re feeling valued. You know it, we know it, but what you might NOT know is how to keep those valued vibes going. We always want to feel needed, loved, accepted, appreciated, seen…all the things! So, here are 5 tips to help you feel valued 24/7. </p>

               <h5>1. Practice Meditation</h5>
               <p>Focus on this great emotion by meditating. Doing this can help you tap back into this emotion when you most need it. If you’re new to meditation, listen to a guided practice that you might find helpful. There are tonsssss of free ones on YouTube that you can listen to! </p>

               <h5>2. Journal</h5>
               <p>Journal about your wins! Write down all the amazing things you feel in this moment and then come back to them at a later time when you need a bit of a pick-me-up. Having journal entries about this emotion, and your successes (big or small), can help you remember why you’re so loved and valued by so many people!</p>

               <h5>3. Practice Gratitude</h5>
               <p>Practicing <b>gratitude</b> can help you recognize and appreciate all the great things that surround you. It can also help you appreciate all the great things about yourself. This might mean writing down all the things that make you feel happy or valued, extending kindness and love to others, or just having a quiet and grateful moment to yourself. </p>

               <h5>4. Engage In Compassionate Self-Talk</h5>
               <p>Positive and compassionate self-talk can help you really tap into, and bring awareness to, this feeling of being valued. Being kind to yourself can help you continue to value yourself (and remember that you deserve all the wonderful things)! </p>

               <h5>5. Practice Deep Breathing</h5>
               <p>You’re probably looking at this tip and thinking “How can breathing help me feel valued?” Well, well, well, do we have a little surprise for you! Deep breathing can help our bodies relax, and help our minds focus in on this positive, fulfilling and loving emotion. Do it with us right now… breathe innnn, and breathe outtttt. We’re already feeling more relaxed! </p>

               <p>And there you have it! You were probably feeling valued before you read this article, but we hope that you feel EVEN MORE valued now. We think you’re amazing and incredible, and we value you and your friendship (even though we’ve never met). Omg long-distance friends? Let’s make it happen!</p>
